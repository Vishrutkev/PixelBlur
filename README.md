# PixelBlur

This project is a command-line application written in Java that allows you to process images by applying various operations such as blurring and edge detection. The application takes an image file (in JPG, PNG, or GIF format) as input and performs the desired operation when triggered by the user.

## Getting Started

To use this application, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone <repository_url>

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

run the program and enter "flower" on the command line and it will open thr GUI.

## Usage

After running the application, a graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear. The window contains a oringinal image on the left-side button labeled "Blur" and "Edge Detection" on the middle and processed image on the right side.

If you select "Blur", the application will apply Gaussian Blur to the image, which helps to reduce noise and create a smoother appearance.

If you select "Edge Detection", the application will perform edge detection on the image, highlighting the boundaries of objects in the image.

After clicking the button the image will be processed and resulting image will show on the right-side.
